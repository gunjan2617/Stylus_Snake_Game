# Virtual_Drawing_Pad
We will create a virtual drawing pad (VDP) that will track an object for drawing. 

## Structure: 
**Step 1:** Find the HSV upper and the lower range of the object to be tracked using trackbars. 
**Step 2:** Applying filters to reduce noice of the frame. 
**Step 3:** Saving the HSV range of the object to be used further in the code. 
**Step 4:** load the HSV value and capture the video 
**Step 5:** Read video and apply suitable morphological operations 
**Step 6:** Find the objectâ€™s x,y coordinates to draw on the screen.
**Step 8:** Detect and track the object with contour detection.
