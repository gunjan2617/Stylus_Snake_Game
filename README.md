# Virtual_Drawing_Pad
We will create a virtual drawing pad (VDP) that will track an object for drawing on the screen. 

## Structure: 
**Step 1:** Find the HSV upper and the lower range of the object to be tracked using trackbars.   
**Step 2:** Applying filters to reduce noice of the frame.  
**Step 3:** Saving the HSV range of the object to be used further in the code.   
**Step 4:** load the HSV value and capture the video.  
**Step 5:** Read video and apply suitable morphological operations.   
**Step 6:** Find the objectâ€™s x,y coordinates to draw on the screen.  
**Step 8:** Detect and track the object with contour detection.

## Concepts Required :
**1.** Image Thersholding   
**2.** Smoothing and filtering   
**3.** Morphological Operations such as Dilation and Erosion  
**4.** Contour Detection  


# Snake_Game 
Creating a snake game operated with keys 

## Structure:   
**Step 1:** Initialise the game window by declaring window parameters that is height and width.  
**Step 2:** Define functions such as for the score, for snake, for output message and for the main game loop.  
**Step 3:** Inside game loop initiate all the variables such as snake's initial position, bool for game close and game over,
length of snake, x and y coordinates of food.   
**Step 4:** Using loop to either continue the game or close the game according to input given.  
**Step 5:** Change the direction of the snake according to LEFT,RIGHT,UP,DOWN keys given as input.  
**Step 6:** Closing the game if touches the hurdle or the game window boundary or itself.  
**Step 7:** Increase length of the snake if it eats the food and then generate the new food at some other position.  


# Stylus_Snake_Game  
The VDP code and snake game code has to be linked

## Structure:  
**Step 1:** Using ROI , take the HSV value of the stylus and average all the values. This is to avoid manually feeding HSV value through trackbars.  
**Step 2:** Define four regions on camera window (LEFT,RIGHT,UP,DOWN).  
**Step 3:** Check if the centroid of the stylus lies inside the region defined. 
**Step 4:** Remove the key part from the snake game code to use stylus.
**Step 5:** Use the cetroid obtained from contours and pass it to the function used for checking the region.  
**Step 6:** Insert hurdles by defining the wall range in x direction and y direction and build up a logic for closing the game if snake touches the hurdle.  
**Step 7:** In this way stylus gets linked to the snake game.

## Concepts Required :
**Step 1:** Use of ROI and image thresholding  
**Step 2:** pygame concepts
