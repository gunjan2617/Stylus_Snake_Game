# Virtual_Drawing_Pad
We will create a virtual drawing pad (VDP) that will track an object for drawing on the screen. 

## Structure: 
**Step 1:** Find the HSV upper and the lower range of the object to be tracked using trackbars.   
**Step 2:** Applying filters to reduce noice of the frame.  
**Step 3:** Saving the HSV range of the object to be used further in the code.   
**Step 4:** load the HSV value and capture the video.  
**Step 5:** Read video and apply suitable morphological operations.   
**Step 6:** Find the objectâ€™s x,y coordinates to draw on the screen.  
**Step 8:** Detect and track the object with contour detection.  

## Concepts Required :
**1.** Image Thersholding   
**2.** Smoothing and filtering   
**3.** Morphological Operations such as Dilation and Erosion  
**4.** Contour Detection
